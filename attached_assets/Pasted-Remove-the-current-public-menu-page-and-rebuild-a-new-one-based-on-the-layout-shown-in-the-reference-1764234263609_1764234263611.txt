Remove the current public menu page and rebuild a new one based on the layout shown in the reference image I uploaded.
Do not use the system’s primary colors. Create a clean, modern, white-based UI with neutral accents (light gray, dark gray, soft black). Avoid blue or any existing system brand colors.

Tasks to Execute
1. Remove the current public menu page

Delete or fully replace the existing UI structure.

Remove all old components, styles, and layout logic that belonged to the previous menu.

2. Rebuild the page following this layout structure (based on the image)
A) Header (top section)

Clean white background

Left side: location icon + delivery address

Center: search bar with rounded corners

Right side: notification + cart + profile icons

Light patterned strip at the top (optional — use a neutral pattern only)

B) Horizontal category menu

Scrollable horizontal list with rounded category buttons

Each button has an icon/image on top and a label below

White background / light gray separators

Very minimal shadows

C) Promo section

3 promotional cards displayed horizontally (scrollable on small screens)

Rounded corners (20–24px)

Vertical gradient from light gray → dark gray (NO red tones, NO blue)

Title + discount info + action button (“Shop Now”)

Cards must be responsive

D) Special offers / product cards

Grid or horizontal scroll list

Each product must be inside a rounded white card with a thin light gray border

Product image on top, label below, small icon (wishlist) on the right

Background must remain neutral (white/light gray)

E) Bottom navigation bar

White background

5 icons: Home, Favorites, Map, History, Profile

Soft gray active indication (no primary system colors)

3. Color palette requirements

Use only:

White (#FFFFFF)

Light Gray (#F5F5F5)

Medium Gray (#D9D9D9)

Dark Gray (#555555)

Black (#000000)
(No colors from the system’s design tokens; no blue, red, or brand colors)

4. Behavior & Functionality

Fully responsive layout

Smooth spacing, large padding

Rounded corners everywhere (16–24px)

Minimal shadows for depth

Keep all text modern and clean

Reuse existing backend data; only replace the interface

5. Final result

Produce a new public menu page visually similar to the reference image but using:
✔ cores neutras
✔ estilo clean premium
